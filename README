minls and minget are Minix filesystem readers. minls lists a file or directory
on a filesystem image and minget copies a regular file from a path in an image
to a given path, if the path is omitted it copies to stdout. 

Program Instructions:

    1. You can build the program by running:

        $ make

          OR

        $ make all

    2. If you want to build the minget and minls programs separately, you 
       can run either of the two commands:
            
        $ make minls        
            
          OR

        $ make minget

    3. You can run the minls executable in the following way:

        minls [ -v ] [ -p part [ -s subpart ] ] imagefile [ path ] 

        > -v flag = putting the program in verbose mode and prints superblock
                    info and inode of source file or directory.

        > -p part = allows the program to choose a primary partition on the
                    image with 'part' being the partition value.

        > -s subpart = allows the program to choose a subpartition in addition
                       to the primary with 'subpart' being the subpart value.

        > imagefile = the given filesystem image that the program with process.

        > path = an optional path argument for the user to traverse the
                 filesystem. Set to root ('/') if ommitted.

    3. You can run the minget executable in the following way:

        minget [ -v ] [ -p part [ -s subpart ] ] imagefile srcpath [ dstpath ]
        
        > -v flag = putting the program in verbose mode and prints superblock
                    info and inode of source file or directory.

        > -p part = allows the program to choose a primary partition on the
                    image with 'part' being the partition value.

        > -s subpart = allows the program to choose a subpartition in addition
                       to the primary with 'subpart' being the subpart value.

        > imagefile = the given filesystem image that the program with process.

        > srcpath = the path argument for the user to traverse the filesystem
                    and find the proper file to read and outputi its data.

        > dstpath = an optional path to copy the srcpath data to. If omitted,
                    it defaults to STDOUT.

    4. In order to clean up and remove all extraneous object files (.o) and
       executables, run the following command:

        $ make clean
